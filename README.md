## How to Play
You will be given a random number at the start of the game. By clicking on the crystals, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. Each round the number is randomized. You win the game by matching your total score to the current random number displayed. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
